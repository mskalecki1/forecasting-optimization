# Forecasting optimization with genetic algorithm
Forecasting a coefficient that represents natural gas consumption of households which is published by distribution system operator on its website (https://www.psgaz.pl/gazowe-zapotrzebowanie-grzewcze).  
Optimizing modelsâ€™ (random forest) hyperparameters with genetic algorithm in order to minimize forecasting error (RMSE or MAPE).  

The project will be gradually updated and more models added.
